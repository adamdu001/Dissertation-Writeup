# Dissertation-Writeup
This is the latex version of the final write-up of my 4th year dissertation project in the University of Warwick.
Project title is "shuffling algorithm and users' perception of randomness, with application to streamed music".
The project was under supervision of Dr.Julia Brettschneider.


The first half of my thesis introduces shuffling theory, i.e. the Top-in-at-random shuffle and riffle shuffle. The second half starts with the use of the Waldâ€“Wolfowitz runs test on the Million Playlists Dataset from Spotify, then a discussion of possible remedies of the multiple testing problem including the Bonferroni Correction and the Benjamini-Hochberg Process.
