abstract = {The ACM Recommender Systems Challenge 2018 focused on automatic music playlist continuation, which is a form of the more general task of sequential recommendation. Given a playlist of arbitrary length, the challenge was to recommend up to 500 tracks that fit the target characteristics of the original playlist. For the Challenge, Spotify released a dataset of one million user-created playlists, along with associated metadata. Participants could submit their approaches in two tracks, i.e., main and creative tracks, where the former allowed teams to use solely the provided dataset and the latter allowed them to exploit publicly available external data too. In total, 113 teams submitted 1,228 runs in the main track; 33 teams submitted 239 runs in the creative track. The highest performing team in the main track achieved an R-precision of 0.2241, an NDCG of 0.3946, and an average number of recommended songs clicks of 1.784. In the creative track, an R-precision of 0.2233, an NDCG of 0.3939, and a click rate of 1.785 was realized by the best team.},

The problem of how to calculate an ideal sample size is also discussed within the context of factors that affect power, and specific methods for the calculation of sample size are presented for two common scenarios, along with extensions to the simplest case.},

 abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},
